# SmartRoom-Capacity-Monitor
This SmartRoom Capacity Monitor uses an Arduino Uno and two IR sensors to track room occupancy. By detecting the sequence of sensor triggers, the system distinguishes between entries and exits, displaying the real-time headcount on a 16x2 LCD. It’s an efficient, non-contact solution for monitoring foot traffic, managing social distancing.
